Abstract
--------

A tool for automatically mount shared resources found in gtk-bookmarks.
The real automount job is done by gvfs when the user starts his session,
just modify the files in /usr/share/gvfs/mounts and set AutoMount = true.

This script is useful in case the network was down when the user started
his session. It'll handle signals from NetworkManager and mount the
shared resources when the network comes alive.

Install
-------

- Copy the .desktop file to /etc/xdg/autostart/gtk-bookmarks-automount.desktop
- Copy the python script to /usr/lib/gtk-bookmarks-automount/gtk-bookmarks-automount.py
